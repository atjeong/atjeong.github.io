      <description>ICCV 2021 (Oral) ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ”—Eungyeup Kim*, Sanghyeon Lee*, Jeonghoon Park*, Somi choi, Choonghyun Seo, Jaegul Choo ðŸ”— Abstract ðŸ”—Deep image colorization networks often suffer from the color-bleeding artifact, a problematic color spreading near the boundaries between adjacent objects. The color-bleeding artifacts debase the reality of generated outputs, limiting the applicability of colorization models on a practical application. Although previous approaches have tackled this problem in an automatic manner, they often generate imperfect outputs because their enhancements are available only in limited cases, such as having a high contrast of gray-scale value in an input image.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Out-of-Distribution Detection Performance of Self-Supervised Learning in a Controllable Environment</title>

      <description>NeurIPS 2020 Workshop: Self-Supervised Learning - Theory and Practice ðŸ”—Jeonghoon Park*, Kyungmin Jo*, Daehoon Gwak*, Jimin Hong, Jaegul Choo, Edward Choi ðŸ”— Abstract ðŸ”—We evaluate the out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance of self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques with a new evaluation framework. Unlike the previous evaluation methods, the proposed framework adjusts the distance of OOD samples from the in-distribution samples. We evaluate an extensive combination of OOD detection algorithms on three different implementations of the proposed framework using simulated samples, images, and text.</description>
